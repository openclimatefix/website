        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
          Solar Photovoltaics (PV) is one of the most significant sources of
          uncertainty in the UKâ€™s power forecasts. To mitigate against the risk
          of a large cloud sweeping across the country (and hence the grid
          losing gigawatts of PV generation), the Electricity System Operator
          (National Grid) keeps lots of natural gas generators operating at less
          than full capacity, so they have headroom to ramp up quickly (spinning
          reserve).
        </p>
        <p>
          These gas turbines are kept idling because they take several hours to
          start up from cold, but they can be ramped up very quickly from idle;
          and the physics of the grid dictate that - at every instant - supply
          must precisely match demand. So, any loss in PV supply must be
          immediately replaced. Spinning reserve costs a lot of money and pumps
          out a lot of CO2.

          These gas turbines are kept ramped down because they take several
          hours to start up from cold, but they can be ramped up quickly once
          they're running. The physics of the grid dictate that, at every
          instant, supply must precisely match demand. So, any loss in PV supply
          must be immediately replaced. Spinning reserve costs a lot of money
          and pumps out a lot of CO2.
        </p>
        <p>
          If National Grid had better PV forecasts, even for the next few hours,
          they could reduce the amount of spinning reserve required, and hence
          reduce emissions (by about 100,000 tonnes per year for the UK{' '}

          ) and reduce costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, this unpredictability of PV power inhibits the investment and
          onboarding of new PV generation farms, as the local and national
          system operators are concerned about these unexpected events
          destabilising the grid. By providing greater visibility of PV power
          output, we can make PV power investments more palatable for all
          stakeholders.

        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>
          Nowcasting is a bit of an odd term. It means "forecasting for the next
          few hours". In general, nowcasting doesn't use the hugely complex and
          computationally-expensive numerical weather models that run on
          supercomputers and constitute the bread-and-butter for most
          forecasting agencies. Instead, nowcasting usually uses statistical or
          machine learning techniques to take recent observations and roll them
          forwards.
        </p>

        <h2>How?</h2>
        <p>
          It turns out that most nowcasting research up until now has been done
          on rainfall (because predicting floods saves lives and property).
          Relatively little research has been done on nowcasting sunlight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our main interest is in trying to build machine learning models to
          forecast solar PV (which basically boils down to trying to predict the
          movement and evolution of clouds). We'd like to spend the majority of
          the next year or two writing code to experiment with new ways to
          predict sunlight for the next few hours. Inputs to the model may
          include satellite images of clouds, numerical weather predictions,
          vertical cloud profiles, and geographical information.
        </p>
        <p>
          As quickly as possible, we'd like to get prototype PV forecasts
          displayed in the National Grid control room, so we can start measuring
          the impact on emissions and cost.
