        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
          Solar Photovoltaics (PV) is the single biggest source of uncertainty
          in the National Grid&apos;s forecasts. To mitigate against the risk of
          a large cloud sweeping across the country (and hence the grid losing
          gigawatts of PV generation), the National Grid keep lots of natural
          gas generators idling (<em>spinning reserve</em>
          ).
        </p>
        <p>
          These gas turbines are kept idling because they take several hours to
          start up from cold, but they can be ramped up very quickly from idle;
          and the physics of the grid dictate that - at every instant - supply
          must precisely match demand. So, any loss in PV supply must be
          immediately replaced. Spinning reserve costs a lot of money and pumps
          out a lot of CO2.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the National Grid had better PV forecasts, even for the next few
          hours, they could reduce the amount of spinning reserve required, and
          hence reduce emissions (by about 100,000 tonnes per year) and reduce
          costs.
        </p>
        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>
          Nowcasting is a bit of an odd term. It means &quot;forecasting for the
          next few hours&quot;. In general, nowcasting doesn&apos;t use the
          hugely complex and expensive numerical weather models that run on
          super computers and constitute the bread-and-butter for most
          forecasting agencies. Instead, nowcasting usually uses statistical
          techniques to take recent observations and
          <em>roll them forwards</em>.
        </p>
        <h2>How?</h2>
        <p>
          It turns out that most nowcasting research up until now has been done
          on rainfall (because predicting floods saves lives). Relatively little
          research has been done on nowcasting sunlight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our main interest is in trying to build machine learning models to
          nowcast solar PV (which basically boils down to trying to predict the
          movement and evolution of clouds). We&apos;d like to spend the
          majority of the next year or two writing code to experiment with new
          ways to predict sunlight for the next few hours. Inputs to the model
          may include satellite images of clouds, numerical weather predictions,
          vertical cloud profiles, and geographical information.
        </p>
        <p>
          As quickly as possible, we&apos;d like to get prototype PV nowcasts
          displayed in the National Grid control room, so we can start measuring
          the impact on emissions and cost.
