This morning Google.org, the philanthropic arm of Google, [announced the successful applicants to the Google.org Impact Challenge on Climate](https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/these-11-organizations-are-building-greener-europe/). The challenge commits €10M to fund “bold ideas that aim to use technology to accelerate Europe’s progress toward a greener, more resilient future”. Our solar electricity Nowcasting project is one of those ideas.

We are super excited that Google.org chose us as one of the successful applicants. This support means the world to us. It will allow us to grow the team further and accelerate the building of solar Nowcasting over the next two years.

Like with everything else we do, all code and research results will be completely open so that they can have the biggest climate impact possible.

The ultimate goal of the solar Nowcasting project is to prove what's possible by applying cutting-edge machine learning to forecast the movement of clouds over the following few hours. After two years, we hope to have researched and built an operational solar electricity nowcasting service that covers all of the UK and Europe.

It feels like so many exciting things are happening at the same time right now! Hopefully in the next few weeks we will have a bit of time to sit down and provide a proper progress update. A lot of cool things have happened recently!
